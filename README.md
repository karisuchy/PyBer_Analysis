# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I created several types of visualizations for the ride-sharing app Pyber.  The charts and graphs show the differences in ride-sharing among different city types: urban, suburban and rural. This information will be used by Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved communities. 

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv; ride_data,csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter 6.3.0, Panda 1.2.4, MatplotLib 3.3.4

## Results
The differences in ride-sharing for the three different city types, urban, suburban, and rural, is quite drastic as demonstrated by the graphics below. 

The volume of rides in rural areas is much lower than suburban and urban areas, and the costs in rural areas are higher.

### Comparison of Rides
- Urban ride count is 1625
- Suburban ride count 625
- Rural ride count 125

### Comparison of Fares
- Urban average fare is $24.53 
- Suburban average fare is $30.97
- Rural average fare is $34.62

### Comparison of Drivers
The number of drivers by city type is 2405 in urban cities, 490 in suburban cities and 78 in rural cities. This means there are almost 5 times the number of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban cities and 30 times the number of drivers in urban cities compared to rural cities.

### Average Fare per Ride and Driver  
The average fare for a suburban driver is more than twice as much as an urbran driver and the average fare for a rural driver is more than three times as much as an urban driver.

### Total Fare by City Type
This final graph shows the total fare by city type over a four-month period in 2019.

## Summary
As demonstrated above, the number of drivers and rides and the total amount of fares are all significantly higher in urban areas, although the cost per individual ride is lower.    
1) Use the average fare per driver comparison to recruit additional drivers in select suburban and rural cities. 
2) Determine if the additional drivers in those select cities lead to increased ride-sharing and profitability. 
3) Expand the recruitment of drivers to additional cities based on the steps above.
