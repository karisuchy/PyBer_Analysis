# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I created several types of visualizations for the ride-sharing app Pyber.  The charts and graphs show the differences in ride-sharing amount different city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural. This information will be used by Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved communities. 

## Resources
Jupyter
Pandas
Matplotlib

city_data.csv
ride_data,csv

## Results

The differences in ride-sharing for the three different city types, Urban, Suburban, and Rural, is quite drastic as demonstrated by all of the graphics below. 

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the:
- total rides, 
- total drivers, 
- total fares, 
- average fare per ride and driver, 
- and total fare by city type (last bar graph, from challenge).

### Rides

Counts: urban - 66, suburban - 36,  rural - 18

### Fares

Urban: mean is $24.53, median is $24.64, mode is $22.86 
Suburban: mean is $
Rural: mean is $

#### Drivers

Average driver count in urban cities is 37, suburban is 14, and rural is 4.  
Average number of drivers in rural cities is nine times less than those in urban cities and four times less than those in suburban cities.

## Summary

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

As demonstrated above, the number of drivers, the amount of fares, and the number of rides are all significantly higher in Urban Cities and sifnificantly lower in Rural Communities.  
1) Recurit additional drivers in a few rural cities to improve availability. Use the results to determine if increasing the availability of drivers leads to increase ride-sharing. 
2) need another
3) and another

All information is available for reivew on Git Hub.
