# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I created several types of visualizations for the ride-sharing app Pyber so they can improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved communities. 

## Resources
Jupyter
Pandas
Matplotlib

city_data.csv
ride_data,csv

## Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the:
- total rides, 
- total drivers, 
- total fares, 
- average fare per ride and driver, 
- and total fare by city type (last bar graph, from challenge).

As demonstrated above, the overall impact of eliminating Thomas High School's ninth grade scores was negligible. A few areas where changes can be seen are: 
- Thomas High School is no longer alone in the second place spot of high performing schools. 
- Math and Reading scores by grade.
- The scores for the $630 - $644 spending bin. 
- The reading and overall percentages for medium size schools

All information is available the shared development environment and is available on Git Hub.
