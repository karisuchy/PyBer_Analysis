# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I created several types of visualizations for the ride-sharing app Pyber.  The charts and graphs show the differences in ride-sharing among different city types: urban, suburban and rural. This information will be used by Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved communities. 

## Resources
Jupyter
Pandas
Matplotlib

city_data.csv
ride_data,csv

## Results
The differences in ride-sharing for the three different city types, urban, suburban, and rural, is quite drastic as demonstrated by the graphics below. 

FROM THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!! There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the:
- total rides, 
- total drivers, 
- total fares, 
- average fare per ride and driver, 
- and total fare by city type (last bar graph, from challenge).

The volumne of rides in rural areas is much lower thatn suburban and urban areas and the costs are higher.

### Rides
Urban: ride count is 1625
Suburban: ride count 
Rural: ride count

### Comparison of Fares
Urban: average fare is $24.53, median is $24.64, mode is $22.86 
Suburban: average fare is $30.97, median is $30.75, mode is $17.99
Rural: average fare is $34.62, median is $37.05, mode is $37.05

#### Drivers
Average driver count in urban cities is 37, suburban is 14, and rural is 4.  
This means the average number of drivers in rural cities is nine times less than those in urban cities and four times less than those in suburban cities.

#### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

As demonstrated above, the number of drivers, the amount of fares, and the number of rides are all significantly higher in Urban Cities and sifnificantly lower in Rural Communities.  
1) Recurit additional drivers in a few rural cities to improve availability. Use the results to determine if increasing the availability of drivers leads to increase ride-sharing. 
2) need another
3) and another

All information is available for reivew on Git Hub.
